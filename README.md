Practical 1 of Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics (first year master AI @ UvA)

## Getting started
* Create a folder '.data' and place the SNLI data from (TODO: website here) in this folder.
* If you want to use the --development feature, copy the .data folder and rename to '.development_data' and limit the .json files to your taste. I used 64x400 train, 64x100 dev and 64x100 test.
